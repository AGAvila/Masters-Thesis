**ABSTRACT OF THE PROJECT**

The objective of this Masterâ€™s Thesis is the development of a portable instrument that
allows the acquisition of the electrocardiogram, both fetal, in the context of a pregnant
woman, and 12 leads for the rest of cases. This device also has generic ports, which allow
the acquisition of new biomedical parameters in a modular way. As a demonstration of this
functionality, the electronics and firmware necessary for the acquisition of the percentage
of oxygen saturation in blood (SpO2) have been developed. The instrument has Bluetooth
Low Energy communication, so that it can be remotely controlled by an user from, for
example, a computer. Likewise, this communication allows this same user to receive the
results acquired for later study and storage. Therefore, a Python application has been
developed to achieve these functionalities.
